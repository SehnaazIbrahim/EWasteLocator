                <h1>About E-waste Facility Locator</h1> 
                <p>Welcome to E-waste Facility Locator, your guide to finding responsible recycling solutions for electronic waste.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to promote environmental sustainability by providing users with easy access to information about nearby e-waste recycling facilities. We believe in the importance of properly disposing of electronic devices to minimize their impact on the environment.</p>
                <p><i>Objectives:</i>

                    Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to all items of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and its parts that have been discarded by its owner as waste without the intent of re-use. An e-waste management system will be aimed at preventing the generation of e-waste, reducing the quantity generated, reusing e-waste, recycling, and disposal. The project aims to provide an interface that will web-enable the public to locate the nearest collection center registered by the MPCB. It will have an input data collection form and using the zip code/municipality the center in that area will be shown as output. A feedback from the public can also be obtained for improvement</p>
                <p>At E-waste Facility Locator, we strive to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Facilitate the proper disposal and recycling of electronic waste</li>
                    <li>Educate individuals and businesses about the importance of e-waste recycling</li>
                    <li>Promote environmentally-friendly practices in the disposal of electronic devices</li>
                </ul>
                <p><i>Thank you for joining us in our efforts to create a cleaner and healthier planet for future generations.</i></p>
